# How does it work? :nerd_face:

This is an application created in NodeJS using the [`github-api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-api) package, which runs on Github Actions whenever a user performs some action in this repository.
<br/>

When the workflow runs, the github token and repository name are passed to the application and used to get access to the repository data. Then the repository is renamed and even this file is updated.
<br/>

That way I know this repository has {stars} stars! :monocle_face:
