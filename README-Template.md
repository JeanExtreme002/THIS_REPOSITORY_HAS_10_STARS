# THIS REPOSITORY HAS {stars} STARS :star:
Click on :star: to see it in action :star_struck:

# How does it work?

This is an application created in NodeJS using the [`github-api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-api) package, which can be easily installed using `npm install github-api`.

<br/>

This application runs, theoretically, every 5 minutes or whenever a user performs some action in the repository. When the program runs, the github token and repository name are passed to the application and used to get access to repository data. Then the repository name and this file are updated. That way I know this repository has {stars} stars. :monocle_face:
